"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["###  Probability Axioms\n","\n","In the early 20th century, Kolmogorov and Von Mises came up with three axioms that further expand on the idea of probability. The three axioms are:\n","\n","#### 1. Positivity\n","\n","A probability is always bigger than or equal to 0, or $0 \\leq P(E) \\leq 1$\n","\n","#### 2. Probability of a Certain Event\n","\n","If the event of interest is the sample space ($S = E$), we say that the outcome is a certain event, or $P(S) = 1$\n","\n","#### 3. Additivity \n","\n","The probability of the union of two exclusive events is equal to the sum of the probabilities of the individual events happening.\n","\n","Remember the inclusion-exclusion principle states that:\n","\n","$\\mid S \\cup T\\mid = \\mid S \\mid + \\mid T \\mid - \\mid S \\cap T \\mid $\n","\n","If we know that $S \\cap T = \\emptyset$ (that there is no intersection between $S$ and $T$, so the set formed by their intersection is the empty set $\\emptyset$), then we can skip that part of the formula, so the cardinality of $S \\cup T$ is simply:\n","\n","$\\mid S \\mid + \\mid T \\mid$\n","\n","The same logic works for the probability of events in two event space sets. If the events are exclusive — they never happen at the same time, so the intersection between them is empty — you can simply add the two probabilities together.\n","\n","If $A \\cap B = \\emptyset $, then $P(A\\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$ \n","\n","### Addition Law of Probability\n","\n","The additivity axiom is great, but most of the time events are not exclusive. Then we need to bring in the rest of the inclusion-exclusion principle (subtracting the intersection), which is now referred to as the **addition law of probability** or the **sum rule** when we are talking about probabilities.\n","\n","$P(A\\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) $ \n","\n","Put in words, the probability that $A$ or $B$ will happen is the sum of the probabilities that $A$ will happen and that $B$ will happen, minus the probability that *both* $A$ and $B$ will happen."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Examples\n","\n","Let's reconsider the dice example to explain what was explained before:\n","\n","### Additivity of Exclusive Events\n","\n","Let's consider two events: event $M$ means throwing a 6, event $N$ means that you throw an odd number ($N={1,3,5}$). These events are exclusive, so you can use the additivity rule if you want to know the answer to the question: \n","\n","_\"what is the probability that your outcome will be a 6, or an odd number?\"_\n","\n","$P(M\\cup N) = P(M) + P(N) = \\dfrac{1}{6}+\\dfrac{3}{6}=\\dfrac{4}{6}=\\dfrac{2}{3}$ \n","\n","There is a 2/3 probability that the outcome will be a 6 or an odd number.\n","\n","### Addition Law of Probability\n","\n","Now, let's consider the same event $N={1,3,5}$ and another event $Q={4,5,6}$. These events are *not* mutually exclusive, so if you want to know the probability that $N$ or $Q$ will happen, you need to use the addition law of probability.\n","\n","Note that $(N \\cap Q)$ is equal to getting an outcome of 5, as that is the \"common\" element in the respective event spaces of $N$ and $Q$.

The probability of throwing any number between 1 and 6 with a die is always exactly $\\dfrac{1}{6}$,  but we can't simply count our messages event space. In words, the probability of sending 20 messages is likely different than the probability of sending, say, 5 messages, and will be different for any number of messages sent. You'll learn about tools to solve problems like these later on.\n","\n","\n","## Summary\n","\n","Well done! In this section, you learned how to use sets to get to probabilities.
